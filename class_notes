routene= detailed set of instructions/functions that perform a specific action so you don't have to repeat yourself. Keep the code dry!

don't make assumptions, Think very carfully "What am I doing?"

every program has a main function (int main())

the statements are inclosed in braces

every program that uses standard services requires the directive "using namespace std;"


Bad habit is to let a compiler find all your compiling errors.

SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS{
___________________________________
  1-Understand the problem

  2-develope and describe an algorithim(sudo code)

  3-test algorithim  with simple inputs

  4-translate into C++

  5-compile and test your program
